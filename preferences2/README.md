II e4 preferences example
====

* In example preferences defined in one plug-in but used in other one.
* Preferences command, handler and view toolbar item exported into model fragment.

NB! If model fragment definition contains referenced command in import section, then it's not enough. You must define new model fragment for it obviously. 
In other case You handler and menu/toolbar item will not work and You will see in console something like this:
```
!MESSAGE Could not resolve import for null
```
